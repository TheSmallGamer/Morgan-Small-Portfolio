# Morgan Small Portfolio

  This git-hub consists of the many projects Morgan Small has worked on in his years in computer science and cyberpatriots throughout his highschool career. Here you will find computer security files, small computer science projects, and partially complete cyber security automated java scripts. Morgan is highly versed in the Java coding language, but learns other coding languages quickly.
  
  
### Contacts
   The Contacts project is a java back-end program that deals with the difficulties of having many contacts to remember. Each individual contact has space for a first and last name, an address, a phone number, and an email address. A basic program coded in around 2 days, maybe, but well created and maintained.
   
### LOC8R
   The LOC8R app is a rough draft project dealing with the location of many locations stored in a database. This app will narrow down a list of over 600 locations in and around the Austin, TX area to specific keywords determined by the user of the program. This fully fleshed out GUI project includes the ability to open up a website window for specific directions to a certain location if the user wishes
   
### Lesson Scheduler
   This program was an individual project for each student to find a client and build a program to fit a certain need in their life. Morgan's client was his father, who is a voice professor at the University of Texas at Austin, so a lesson scheduler was the best thing to create for him. With a fully working GUI front end, this program can be logged into by both a student and an administrator figure, so each participating party can use the app to its fullest potential
   
### Wahoot.it
   This was a fun class project created by the 2018-2019 senior class in computer science. This program closely mimics the game Kahoot.it, the online testing website that teachers use to teach their students while also keeping their students entertained. While not fully complete, this backend gives the user a fun experience while learning things about certain programmable subjects
   
### Cyber Patriots Private Project -- *CyberKey*
   As one of the most important projects of his life, CyberKey is Morgan's gift to the TX861st AFJROTC CyberPatriot teams. This program, while still under development, automizes many aspects of the team's competition so they are able to complete many items faster and accurately, using batch files embedded within the file
